    "# Analyzing Milwaukee Police Call Data and Weather Data\n",
    "### Grant Fass and Chris Hubbell\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Across the world, there are many crimes commited every hour. One of the greatest challenges is reducing crime and maintaining safety for citizens. Part of preventing crime relies on the reporting of it by citizens. If nobody informs the police, the police are unable to act. This is why reporting crimes and incidents is so important, especially when people's lives are in danger. In Wisconsin, Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) releases data regarding all of their dispatch calls, which we have been able to get since 2016. This allows for analyzing trends of crime reporting over time as well as as it relates to other factors. In 2010, Milwaukee installed a new system for detecting gun shots called ShotSpotter, which was expanded into more neighborhoods in 2014. This system is capable of detecting when a shot is fired and where it was to a high degree of accuracy. The data consists of both ShotSpotter calls as well as Shots Fired calls. The key difference is that Shots Fired are calls from people and ShotSpotter are automatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions:\n",
    "- Is there a significant difference between the distribution of shots spotted over time and calls for shots fired?\n",
    "- Is there a significant difference in the number of calls that were unable to be located for shots fired calls compared to shots spotted?\n",
    "- Does the number of shots spotted and fired correlate with certain dates including holidays and events?\n",
    "- Does the number of calls correlate with certain weather conditions?\n",
    "- Is it possible to predict number of calls based on location and district?\n",
    "- Is it possible to predict the nature of a call based on its location and district?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses:\n",
    "- There are significantly more shots spotted than calls about shots fired.\n",
    "- Significantly more shots fired calls are unable to be located than shots spotted.\n",
    "- There will be significantly more shots spotted calls on July 4th, Dec. 31st, and Jan 1st than normal days.\n",
    "- There will be significantly less shots fired calls on holidays than normal days.\n",
    "- There are significantly more calls on days with clear weather than inclement weather.\n",
    "- There are significantly more calls on days around 75 degrees than there are on days around 95 or 55 degrees.\n",
    "- The number of calls will be able to be predicted based on location and district.\n",
    "- The type of call will be unable to be predicted based on location and district.\n"

    "The first data set that will be evaluated in this notebook is stored in `mkecallswheader.csv`. This dataset comes from requesting the bulk data option from a [website](https://mpd.digitalpublicworks.com/?start=2019-01-05T00:00:00-06:00&end=2019-01-05T23:59:59.999999-06:00) that scrapes the milwaukee police department call logs found [here](https://itmdapps.milwaukee.gov/MPDCallData/) and stores them. This data is stored in a postgres server. The official .gov site shows that the data should have headers of call number, date/time, location, police district, nature of call, and status. The bulk data stored in the .csv file has a couple extra headers of id, inserted_at, updated_at, and point. These features will need to be dropped later on since they do not pertain to the data itself and are an artifact of how the data was stored."

Of these features there are two features that are formatted as integers and eight features formatted as the default object that pandas imports non-numerical features as. From the object classified features there are a few that can be converted to new types. The time column should be formatted as a date time object. District should be converted to a numerical categorical value. Nature and status should be converted to categorical features. Location should be kept as an object feature. More features should be extracted from the location in order to draw further observations. Both street name and street suffix would be good features to extract."
